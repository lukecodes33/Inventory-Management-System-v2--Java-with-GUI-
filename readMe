This program is something i have decided to try and create based on my experience working with various warehouse
environment applications. It is a barebones small scale inventory management system that would be effective for
small scale businesses to use to keep track of inventory, orders and allow specific permissions to the required
users.

I have previously created a command line version of this in python however i have decided due to wanting a nicer GUI
and an upgrade to speed, i am re creating it in java. If you are downloading this your initial login will be

User: Admin
password: firstLogin

all password resets and database creating will be done on first login.
